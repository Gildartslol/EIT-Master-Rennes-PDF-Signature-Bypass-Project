# PDF signature bypass

Main.py contains the code to correctly generate all the differents USF variantes for cracking a pdf signature. Opening them with a text editor and searching for the signature object is enought to see how is it working. Also using an old pdf viewer should be sufficient to see how this vulnerabilty is bypassed.
